# Fermi

This app was created originally as a Java project for school. Guess the numbers in the correct order to win!

## Techs I used

React, CSS, Bootstrap.

## What I Learned

I re-learned quite a bit about state management with this project. I refactored the code a couple times during development, and could probably use another sweep. The logic for Fermi is fairly straight forward, most of the challenge came from creating it in React.
